## Introduction
You are going to form a team of three to work on a project. The project is about web scraping - retrieving and analysing data from some websites automatically. You will be provided with a skeleton code written in Java that is capable of fetching some data from the HKUST course website. 
Codebase at GitHub: https://github.com/namkiu2020/comp3111-project-2020s 
## System Requirements
There are 6 tasks for each team to complete. Each student should complete TWO of the tasks. All tasks are closely related, and team members are expected to work together collaboratively in delivering a fully functional system. In most cases, no point will be awarded if a related task has not been completed. Points are given in an all-or-nothing manner.
